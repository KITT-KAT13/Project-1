<h3>Today, we are celebrating mothers, for their hard work and dedication. And as today is mothers and here is a poem about
mothers <br> A mother's love, a steady flame,
A heart that calls you by your name.
Through every storm and every trial,
She walks beside you, mile by mile.</h3>

<h3>Her hands, though worn, are soft and kind,
With every gesture, peace you'll find.
She’s the warmth beneath the skies,
The sparkle in a child's eyes.</h3>

<h3>
    She whispers wisdom, soft but true,
    A beacon that will guide you through.
    In moments quiet, or when loud,
    She’s the shelter in the crowd.
    
    Her laughter, like a song so sweet,
    A rhythm to which hearts will beat.
    In every hug, in every kiss,
    She gifts a world of endless bliss.
    
    For in a mother's heart, you see,
    A love that’s deep, a love that’s free.
    She’s the first to hold you near,
    A bond that time can’t interfere.
    
    To all the mothers, near and far,
    You shine like every guiding star.
    Your love, a light that always shows,
    In your embrace, the world still grows.
    
</h3>
